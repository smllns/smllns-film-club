## About

This site showcases my entire rated movie collection from **Letterboxd**—over **2000 films**—presented through a rich and dynamic **visual experience** filled with animations, smooth transitions, and interactive effects.

You can **browse** the full collection, **search** movies by **title** or **year**, and explore detailed movie pages enriched with posters and metadata from **The Movie Database (TMDb) API**.  
I’ve also curated **four unique movie lists** reflecting different themes and moods, and there is a dedicated **contact page** with all my social links.  
Each movie entry links back to its original **Letterboxd** page, combining the joy of discovery with a love for creative coding.

This project is my way to merge **code and creativity**, sharing my favorite hobby through an immersive web experience.
